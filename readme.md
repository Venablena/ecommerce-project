# eCommerce Site

### Overview

You will be working with a team to create a mockup of an eCommerce site. Together, you will create the basic structure of the site which includes at least two pages:

* [Homepage](./mockups/homepage.png)
  * [Live Example](https://bwreid.github.io/ecommerce-example)

You may complete either or both of the following:

* [Products](./mockups/products.png)
  * [Live Example](https://bwreid.github.io/ecommerce-example/products.html)
* [Checkout](./mockups/checkout.png)
  * [Live Example](https://bwreid.github.io/ecommerce-example/checkout.html)

### Specifications

In addition to meeting the look of the wireframes above, your website should meet the following specifications:

##### Homepage

* A carousel should be present on the homepage with at least three different images.
* At least three products will be on the homepage. When you hover over them, "Add to Cart" should appear.
* The "Sign Up Today" input box should validate that what is entered is a valid email. If it is not, show an error to the user. If it is valid, remove the email and show a success message.
* A footer should include at least four columns.
* The number of items in the "Checkout" may be static.

##### Products Page

* Each product must have an associated picture, price, and name
* Products can be filtered by price and at least one other category (they do not need to be filtered by both at the same time)

##### Checkout Page

* Show a "receipt" on the page (may be static).
* Validate user input in the shipping form.
* Include a checkbox that, when checked, will automatically fill the billing form.
* When a user submits and something is incorrect on the page, show a custom error. If everything is valid, clear all fields and show a success message.

##### Stretch

* Allow users to add and persist items with local storage.
* Build your carousel from scratch.
* Auto-format zip codes and credit card numbers.
